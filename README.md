# Three sport games in a Virtual Reality room

In this project, the goal is to create a room where the virtual player can have joy while throw a golf ball in the trash or try to play golf or yet try to keep a tennis ball bounce in the racket. 
It is the final development for the discipline IGR205 at Telecom Paris, France.
